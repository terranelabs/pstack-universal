# How

Explore the codebase to answer "how does X work?" questions. Produce architectural explanations at the level of a senior engineer onboarding onto a subsystem, enough to build a working mental model, not so much that it reads like annotated source code.

Read **pstack-runtime** before delegating. Use `.pstack/config.yaml` role
preferences only when the current host supports them. Explorers use the
`explorer` role. Explainers use `judgment`. Missing configuration means
`inherit-parent`. Use only model identifiers the host reports as available.
If an override is rejected, inherit the parent model and report the fallback.
Choose reasoning and speed settings only when the host exposes them, as
described in the Subagents section of **poteto-mode**. Every worker has a scope
that forbids file and external writes. If delegation is unavailable or
prohibited, perform the same steps in the parent session.

## 1. Assess complexity

If the scope is ambiguous, state your interpretation and explore. The user can redirect.

- **Simple** (a single module, a small utility, a narrow question such as "how does function X work"): use one explainer that explores and explains in one pass. Build its prompt from `references/explainer-prompt.md` without the explorer findings section. Go to step 4.
- **Complex** (a subsystem spanning multiple files or services, a cross-cutting feature, a full architectural overview): go to step 2.

When in doubt, take the simple path.

## 2. Explore (complex only)

Decompose the question into 2 to 4 angles, each a distinct slice of the
subsystem. Launch the explorers concurrently up to the host's concurrency
limit. Give each `references/explorer-prompt.md` with its angle filled in.
Investigate any remaining angles sequentially.

## 3. Synthesize (complex only)

Once all explorers have returned, use one explainer with
`references/explainer-prompt.md` and every explorer's findings filled in.

## 4. Present

Present the explainer's output. Light edits for clarity or context from the conversation are fine. Do not substantially rewrite it.

## Output format

The explanation uses the sections defined in `references/explainer-prompt.md`, dropping any that do not apply: Overview, Key Concepts, How It Works, Where Things Live, Gotchas.
